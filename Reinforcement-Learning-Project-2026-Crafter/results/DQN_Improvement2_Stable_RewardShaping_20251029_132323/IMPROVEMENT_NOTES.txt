DQN IMPROVEMENT 2: Strategic Reward Shaping

ANALYSIS OF PREVIOUS RESULTS:
Baseline:        4.4 reward | 205 survival | 0/22 achievements
Old Improv1:     3.1 reward | 163 survival | 7/22 achievements  (FAILED)
Fixed Improv1:   4.1 reward | 176 survival | 6/22 achievements  (PARTIAL SUCCESS)

KEY INSIGHT FROM IMPROV1:
- Agent learned achievements BUT at cost of survival
- Peak performance (4.9) beat baseline, but average (4.1) slightly lower
- Trade-off: exploration for achievements vs survival optimization
- Need to align incentives: survival + achievements = maximum reward

IMPROVEMENTS IN VERSION 2:

1. STRATEGIC REWARD SHAPING:
   Tiered achievement rewards:
   - Tier 1 (Basic): collect_drink +5, place_plant +8
   - Tier 2 (Resources): collect_wood +10, collect_coal +12
   - Tier 3 (Building): place_table +15, place_furnace +15
   - Tier 4 (Tools): make_pickaxe +15-20, make_sword +15-20
   - Tier 5 (Combat): defeat_zombie +20, defeat_skeleton +25
   
   First unlock bonus: +5 additional reward
   Repeat unlock: 50% of base reward (encourages consistency)

2. SURVIVAL INCENTIVES:
   - Milestone bonuses: +2 reward every 100 steps
   - Health maintenance: +0.1 if health >7
   - Hunger maintenance: +0.1 if food >7
   - Damage penalty: -1.0 when taking damage
   - Death penalty: -5.0 to discourage reckless play

3. BALANCED OBJECTIVES:
   Instead of: Survival OR Achievements
   Now: Survival AND Achievements = Maximum Reward
   
   Agent learns that:
   - Long survival + achievements = best reward
   - Short survival + achievements = medium reward
   - Long survival + no achievements = baseline reward
   - Short survival + no achievements = low reward

4. KEPT FROM IMPROV1:
   - Stable CNN architecture (no batch norm)
   - Observation normalization
   - Extended exploration (25%)
   - Conservative learning rate (1e-4)

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:
Mean reward:    >5.0 (beat both baseline and improv1)
Survival:       >200 (match/beat baseline)
Achievements:   >8 (significantly beat improv1's 6)
Stability:      High (stable architecture + aligned incentives)

TARGET PERFORMANCE:
Conservative: 5.0-5.5 reward, 200+ survival, 8-10 achievements
Optimistic:   5.5-6.5 reward, 220+ survival, 12-15 achievements

KEY INNOVATION:
This improvement doesn't change the algorithm or architecture.
Instead, it changes the REWARD SIGNAL to align with our goals.
This is a fundamental RL principle: good reward design is critical!
